    what_they_says:
      - name: Annie
        title: E i-TRUE Rails Engineer
        img: annie.jpg
        content: By learning with 5xRuby, It helped me increase my development efficiency and be able to write maintainable code, which saves me a lot of time. Besides, the community 5xRuby built helps me to meet many industry experts, understand the common problem in projects, the best practice when development and how to cooperate with team members. For those company which want to cultivate more good engineer, I would highly recommend to choose 5xRuby.
      - name: Okay
        title: 5xRuby iOS Engineer
        img: okay.jpg
        content: Started to learn programming since 2015, it was very lucky to meet 5xRuby in the early stage of my programming career. The way the teacher teached was very logical and easy to understand. They also encouraged students to come to meetup to get consultation and join the community. 5xRuby is really a reliable, serious, outstanding company, it is definitely the best choice to learn programming. <3<3<3
      - name: Yu-Sheng Li
        title: 5xRuby Rails Engineer
        img: bill.jpg
        content: As a junior engineer, I think there are too many things you have to learn which may take you several years even decades. What we really need is the ability to keep learning and be self-taught. I was very lucky to be Eddie’s student. The course was different from other normal course you could imagine, because the teacher himself is the senior engineer, so what he taught are all about what a good engineer should do, and how to be a good engineer. So you can really make you application work, know how it works, some common mistake that newbies make and what details are important while working. It can prevent students losing there confidence when they start to do a real project.<br><br>More importantly, the teachers not only teach you the skill, but also let you know the logic and philosophy behind scenes. At the same time, the teacher will walk students through common question, teach how to solve the problem, consult the official document and  cultivate the good habit to write test.
    qnas:
      - q: Why company should interview the possible trainee?
        a: Because every company has different culture and needs, even though a excellent developer won't fit every company. So we suggest companies to sent the 'right' people by interviewing first.
      - q: How you charge?
        a: For per trainee, we will charge 15-20% of annual salary from the company. And We will also charge 1 month salary from the trainee, but they will get half monthly salary as refund if they pass probation.
      - q: Is this job-guarantee?
        a: Yes, because the training program will start after signing contract with company, unless the company cut the contract, or you can think of it as job-guarantee.
      - q: Could get 6-8 weeks training to be on part with junior developer?
        a: If you can practice 3 days a week plus intense training and developing a real project, you will be able to be on part with junior developer.

      ##  5 times professionalism. 5 times wishes. 5 times Ruby.
      ### About Us
      We are a group of Ruby lovers in Taiwan. Our lives are closely bounded with Ruby/Rails.

      Ruby on Rails saves time on development, and has been favored by many foreign enterprises and start-ups. The simplicity and elegance of Ruby language brings a lot of fun to the engineers too. However, in Taiwan, only a few enterprises are using Ruby/Rails as their main developing tool.

      Over the years we have continuously provided lectures to universities in Taiwan (NCKU, Fujen University, TTCB), teaching Ruby and Rails. What we have noticed from student reactions, is that most students find Ruby not so difficult to learn. They could achieve a certain level by studying textbooks and practicing via documents from the official website. However, self-study cannot cover all aspects if they wish to elevate into the next level or start working on business projects. They need more authentic practices and the guidance of lecturers. This is why senior or experienced Ruby/Rails developers are not easy to be found in Taiwan.

      We have also interviewed some enterprises and came to understand the reason why they don't use Ruby/Rails. Most of it comes from the shortage of Ruby/Rails engineers, and that technical support is scarce too. They don't know who to ask for help if a problem occurs.

      In recent years, the demand of Ruby/Rails expertise grew, more high-paid vacancies were released, encouraging more people to enter the world of Ruby/Rails. Many people have, besides self-learning, participated in the sharing and exchanges of activities organized by Ruby communities.

      "If only there were a faster and more efficient way to enhance my skills." Voices like this started to appear.

      Therefore, a group of Ruby lovers thought, "Maybe we can establish a company to provide technical consulting or training related to Ruby/Rails."

      Our ultimate goal is for more enterprises in Taiwan to know about this elegant, fun and very productive programming language, and start using it as their main development tool to speed up their dreams.

      As to why the company name is 5 times and not 3 or 100 times? Well, that's another story.

        intro:
          - text: Cat 是一名面對未來樂觀開朗的女孩，喜歡大笑，喜歡做自己。儘管不是程式相關背景畢業的女生，但是面對程式總是展露認真又好奇的心態。
          - text: 以前想要表達腦中的想法，都是用平面設計實際去繪圖，現在則是會選擇使用 CSS 這樣的魔術展現出來。
          - text: 自己平時也會多嘗試使用 CSS 練習畫不一樣的圖案，可以學習到很多小技巧，而這些小技巧累積越多，在商業用途上有特殊需求時就會很直接的反應，切不出來的板型也會越來越少。
          - text: 這樣的堅持，是因為她跨出嘗試程式領域的那一步，因此愛上了程式，喜歡上 CSS，從此，程式界也多了 Cat 的笑聲。
