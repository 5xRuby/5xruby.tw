        img: annie.jpg
        content: 與五倍一起學習，使我在公司開發專案時，能更快進入狀況且明顯加快開發效率，尤其在寫出可維護的程式碼上，節省不少自我摸索的時間。另外，五倍強大的人脈，讓我認識許多業界專家，發掘專案常見問題，開發上的實務技巧，以及如何團隊協作。如果想培養出企業所需的即戰力，我相信與五倍一起學習會是一個很棒的選擇。

        content: 2015 年從零開始接觸程式語言，在我的程式生涯開端很幸運地遇見了五倍紅寶石，講師在一字一鍵的教學中，從基礎觀念由淺入深到實戰經驗，架構清晰邏輯清楚，課後也非常鼓勵學員到礦坑解除各種技術障、參加社群活動，交流分享毫不藏私。 五倍紅寶石正派經營、用心實在、技術一流，是學習程式語言的首選無誤 <3<3<3

        title: 五倍紅寶石 Rails 工程師
        img: bill.jpg
        content: 身為一個菜鳥工程師，我認為踏入程式設計師的修行之路是永無止盡的，要學的東西並非短短幾個月、幾年可以通通學完，需要的是持續的自我學習。去年有幸在五倍紅寶石成為龍哥的學生，與一般你所認知的進修課程不同，因為老師本身平時就是以他所教授的東西為工作，你可以很紮實的從讓程式動起來、到了解背後的運作，並且直接得知新手常犯的錯誤、工作上應該要留意的細節，而不是等到實作後才自己陷入無止盡地踩雷地獄。<br><br>更重要的是，除了讓你具備實戰的能力，講師們會仔細告訴你程式背後的設計原理跟哲學，讓你不只會運用、更知道什麼時候適合用、該怎麼用；同時老師也會在課堂中實際帶大家解決問題、查閱手冊、培養諸如寫測試等工作應該具備的好習慣，讓你在實際在遇到問題時有自己去解決問題、自我成長的能力。
    qnas:
      - q: 為什麼要由企業面試可能人選?
        a: 每個企業的文化以及氣場不同，即使技術很厲害的開發者也不一定跟企業合得來，我們建議由企業先行面試「合得來」的人再來進行訓練。
      - q: 費用怎麼算?
        a: 對企業，我們會收取 15 ~ 20% 年薪做為服務費；對受訓的學員，我們會先收取一個的月薪，待到職滿試用期後可退回半個月的月薪。
      - q: 保證就業嗎?
        a: 是的，因為我們是先跟企業簽定合約才會開始進行，除非企業因故中止合約，否則可以視為保證就業。
      - q: 6 ~ 8 週就有辦法達到企業的需求嗎?
        a: 如果是一週三天以上密集的訓練加上實際專案的磨練，只要不要太混，在 6 ~ 8 週應該可以練到可以用的程度沒問題。

      ##  5 times professionalism. 5 times wishes. 5 times Ruby.
      ### About Us
      We are a group of Ruby lovers in Taiwan. Our lives are closely bounded with Ruby/Rails.

      Ruby on Rails saves time on development, and has been favored by many foreign enterprises and start-ups. The simplicity and elegance of Ruby language brings a lot of fun to the engineers too. However, in Taiwan, only a few enterprises are using Ruby/Rails as their main developing tool.

      Over the years we have continuously provided lectures to universities in Taiwan (NCKU, Fujen University, TTCB), teaching Ruby and Rails. What we have noticed from student reactions, is that most students find Ruby not so difficult to learn. They could achieve a certain level by studying textbooks and practicing via documents from the official website. However, self-study cannot cover all aspects if they wish to elevate into the next level or start working on business projects. They need more authentic practices and the guidance of lecturers. This is why senior or experienced Ruby/Rails developers are not easy to be found in Taiwan.

      We have also interviewed some enterprises and came to understand the reason why they don't use Ruby/Rails. Most of it comes from the shortage of Ruby/Rails engineers, and that technical support is scarce too. They don't know who to ask for help if a problem occurs.

      In recent years, the demand of Ruby/Rails expertise grew, more high-paid vacancies were released, encouraging more people to enter the world of Ruby/Rails. Many people have, besides self-learning, participated in the sharing and exchanges of activities organized by Ruby communities.

      "If only there were a faster and more efficient way to enhance my skills." Voices like this started to appear.

      Therefore, a group of Ruby lovers thought, "Maybe we can establish a company to provide technical consulting or training related to Ruby/Rails."

      Our ultimate goal is for more enterprises in Taiwan to know about this elegant, fun and very productive programming language, and start using it as their main development tool to speed up their dreams.

      As to why the company name is 5 times and not 3 or 100 times? Well, that's another story.
