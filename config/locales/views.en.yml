        ### About Us
        We are a group of Ruby lovers in Taiwan. Our lives are closely bounded with Ruby/Rails.

        Ruby on Rails saves time on development, and has been favored by many foreign enterprises and start-ups. The simplicity and elegance of Ruby language brings a lot of fun to the engineers too. However, in Taiwan, only a few enterprises are using Ruby/Rails as their main developing tool.

        Over the years we have continuously provided lectures to universities in Taiwan (NCKU, Fujen University, TTCB), teaching Ruby and Rails. What we have noticed from student reactions, is that most students find Ruby not so difficult to learn. They could achieve a certain level by studying textbooks and practicing via documents from the official website. However, self-study cannot cover all aspects if they wish to elevate into the next level or start working on business projects. They need more authentic practices and the guidance of lecturers. This is why senior or experienced Ruby/Rails developers are not easy to be found in Taiwan.

        We have also interviewed some enterprises and came to understand the reason why they don't use Ruby/Rails. Most of it comes from the shortage of Ruby/Rails engineers, and that technical support is scarce too. They don't know who to ask for help if a problem occurs.

        In recent years, the demand of Ruby/Rails expertise grew, more high-paid vacancies were released, encouraging more people to enter the world of Ruby/Rails. Many people have, besides self-learning, participated in the sharing and exchanges of activities organized by Ruby communities.

        "If only there were a faster and more efficient way to enhance my skills." Voices like this started to appear.

        Therefore, a group of Ruby lovers thought, "Maybe we can establish a company to provide technical consulting or training related to Ruby/Rails."

        Our ultimate goal is for more enterprises in Taiwan to know about this elegant, fun and very productive programming language, and start using it as their main development tool to speed up their dreams.

        As to why the company name is 5 times and not 3 or 100 times? Well, that's another story.

        ## Our Services
        ### Technical Consulting
        The members and lecturers of __5xRuby__ are the first-line developers in the market and senior members from Taiwan's Ruby community, where actual developing experience and pragmatics come in hand with theoretical basis.

        ### Enterprise Internal Training
        If your website or system is currently built with other programming languages (for instance PHP, Java or ASP.net), and you are considering changing to Ruby/Rails for high productivity, yet lack the technical capabilities to develop, we offer a series of training programs where the Ruby/Rails development team can be trained and built with your current staff. There is no need to go through the hassle of recruiting process, thus avoiding the problem of new-comers getting used to the team culture.

        ### Training
        if you are a fresh beginner to programming, or if you happen to have experience with other programming languages, we offer a series of lectures from entry level to intermediate and advanced, that will guide you efficiently to the core of Ruby/Rails.
